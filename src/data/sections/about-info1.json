  "paragraph1": "Dipesh has a little off-the-usual story.  From an educational point of view, he is a qualified chartered accountant and was a practicing CPA in the finance world for 11 years.  Later on, Dipesh quit his job, learnt development and qualified as an Ethereum Blockchain Developer from the ConsenSys Academy. While Dipesh was a practising CPA, he used to tinker around with technology products after his work hours.  Soon, his job interests were overtaken by his hobby and in 2017 he quit his settled job to develop his career in the tech industry.  Biting the bug of smart contract development, Dipesh began his journey in development while co-founding and assisting in the development of Indorse (https://indorse.io/).  ",
  "paragraph2": "From 2017 to 2019, Dipesh was developing business and product at Indorse.  Fast forward to 2019, Dipesh took the decision to move out of business development, to do product development, full time.
